      question: "What if I've been told I'm not a candidate?",
      answer: "We hear this all the time â€” and most patients still qualify. Advances in dental implant technology mean that even patients with bone loss, diabetes, or other conditions can often receive implants. We use advanced 3D imaging and bone grafting techniques when needed. During your free consultation, we'll give you an honest assessment of your options.",

      question: "Will insurance help?",
      answer: "Some insurance plans do provide coverage for implant procedures, especially when they're medically necessary. We'll guide you through every step of the insurance process and help maximize your benefits. We also offer flexible financing options with low monthly payments, so you don't have to wait to get the smile you deserve.",

      question: "Is it painful?",
      answer: "We offer sedation. Most patients say they felt nothing during the procedure and are surprised by how comfortable they were. We use the latest pain management techniques, and many patients return to work the next day. Your comfort is our priority throughout the entire process.",

      question: "How long does it take?",

For some patients, the process may take 3-6 months depending on healing and specific needs. We'll give you a personalized timeline during your consultation.",
